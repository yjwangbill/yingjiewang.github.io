Hi, I’m a Research Fellow in the Generative AI Lab at Nanyang Technological University, working with Prof. Dacheng Tao. Previously, I was a Lecturer at China University of Petroleum (East China) and an Algorithm Engineer at JD.com.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on the theoretical foundations of deep and foundation models. I study generalization, optimization dynamics, scaling behavior, and reliability/alignment (robustness, privacy, and controllable reasoning), and translate these insights into algorithms, diagnostics, and benchmarks. The goal is to make large models more sample-efficient, trustworthy, and predictable.

Hiring Info: We are recruiting PhD students with strong theoretical backgrounds in mathematics, statistics, or related areas to join Prof. Dacheng Tao’s group at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and Prof. Liu’s group at China University of Petroleum (East China), with opportunities to join other leading universities.

Potential Collaborations: If you are interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out with the potential area of research you would like to contribute to!
